Lars van Vianen is a meta-designer and founding director of Scape Agency. Proceeding from a background in interactive art, experience design and parametric architecture, Lars explores the convergence of synthetic biology, materials science, artificial intelligence and robotic construction. Believing the principle of design is the decodation of dreams into the parametrization and instrumentalization of reality, he exerts computation to concurrently operate across scales and mediate between natural and artificial actors.

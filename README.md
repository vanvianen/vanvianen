Lars van Vianen is a meta-designer and founding director of Scape Agency. Proceeding from a background in interactive art, experience design and parametric architecture, Lars explores the convergence of synthetic biology, materials science, artificial intelligence and robotic construction. Believing the principle of design is the decodation of dreams into the parametrization and instrumentalization of reality, he exerts computation to concurrently operate across scales and mediate between natural and artificial actors. Lars holds a bachelor diploma in building technology, later studied architecture at Hyperbody and curated INDESEM (International Design Seminar) at the Delft University of Technology. He has prior professional experience as designer, software developer, technical producer and innovation manager at several established art, architecture and construction practices.
